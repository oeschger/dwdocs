The developers at the event were amazing and they all brought their high-powered laptops and backpacks filled with IoT devices to the AT&amp;T Stadium to show what they could do.<br /><br /></span></span></div><div><span><span>One developer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-hsu-0a0a4164" target="_blank">Michael Hsu</a>, who is an instructor at Cal State, told us he has been playing Pokemon Go all week and he had the idea to see if Watson's Visual Recognition API could be used to 'watch for' specific Pokemon.  This is a really clever use of the Watson service and is certainly not something it's designers had in mind when it was created.  </span></span></div><div><span><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Pokemon Go uses augmented reality to overlay images on the camera view of your mobile phone.  Michael used the Watson Visual Recognition service and trained it to recognize specific Pokemon.  In a crowded environment, this might be the fastest and only way to find that rare and elusive Electabuzz or Marowak.<br /><br /></span></span></div><span><span>While finding Pokemon might appear to be a light use of IBM's powerful Watson, IoT and Cloud capabilities, it actually goes a long way to introducing IBM to a new generation and a new set of developers around the world who can now see what we can do.  And, once developers see what's possible, there is simply no stopping them!!!!<br /></span></span><h3 dir="ltr"><span>Watch a summary of their winning solution </span></h3><p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB7imgUQ26Y[/embed]</p><p>You can find out more about <span class="s1"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/" target="_blank">Watson IoT</a>, the </span><a href="http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html"><span class="s1">Watson’s Visual Recognition App</span></a><span> or the </span><a href="https://shape.att.com/"><span class="s1">AT&amp;T Shape Tech Expo site</span></a><span>. <br />But better yet why don't you get started with it yourself, and see what you can build ? Sign up now for a </span><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/trial/" target="_blank">free 30-day trial of Bluemix</a>.</span><span><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>
