We have updated the "Internet of Things Foundation Starter" Bluemix Boilerplate, to include a new node for IoT applications which is the first of a few steps to make the experience of building application in Bluemix and Node-RED even more straight-forward.
The new node has all the functionality of the previous one but the topic string is built from appropriate context aware entries in the configuration dialog, there are different entries for QuickStart and registered devices for example.
The new boilerplate also installs the sample flow the first time you start it up, any changes you make are preserved just like before. 
For now the old node is still installed (slightly confusing identified by being light blue!), in case you have have demo scripts which depend on it but please try the new node too.
