I’m pleased to announce that the IBM Watson IoT Platform now has the ability to add Internet of Things (IoT) data, to Blockchain transactions. Leveraging blockchain for your IoT data opens up new ways of automating business processes amongst your partners without setting up an expensive centralized IT infrastructure.  This gives you the potential to improve business networks, reduce costs, increase trust and open up new markets. 

A <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=WWS12352USEN" target="_blank">solution brief</a> provides an overview of the capabilities and use cases being announced. 

The new features within the Watson IoT Platform are available through two new Lab Services Offerings. These Lab Services offerings are designed to help clients rapidly identify key use cases, in an agile fashion, to reduce risk and maximise return on investment.

The Lab Services Offerings are 
1) Discovery Workshop
2) First Project Quick Win

To find out more about IoT and blockchain or to get started in a project using IoT Lab Services, <a href="http://ibm.co/iot-blockchain" target="_blank">explore our website</a>.  The website has details of example use cases for IoT Blockchain and information on how to contact us.

IBM has already started assisting clients with identifying their top use cases for the application of IoT data in Blockchain transactions, examples include:
- Trade Lane Logistics and Supply chain
- Warranty - Asset Management
- Asset Management - parts tracking
- Regulatory compliance

The use cases can vary and are not limited to the ones identified above. If you have a business network, have or intend to have IoT devices and you are challenged by consensus, visibility and existing business processes that are expensive and inefficient, then you might have an additional use case already…explore with IBM experts today.
