As part of improving our notifications to our users we have created a Service Status page <a href="http://status.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/service-status/" target="_blank">here</a> where you can see the status of the core IoT Foundation Services.  We will also be posting all planned outages to the blog on this site <a href="http://status.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/" title="Service Notices" target="_blank">here</a>.  This is a change to where we had been posting updates, but we want to make things clearer for our users and keep all our service related items in one place.

We also have a Twitter ID you can follow for updates to our Service too, please follow <a href="https://twitter.com/IoTFNotify" title="IoTFNotify" target="_blank">IoTFNotify</a>.
