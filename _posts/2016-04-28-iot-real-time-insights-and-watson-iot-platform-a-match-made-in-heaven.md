<blockquote><p><b>Update:</b> I'm pleased to announce that the IoT Platform and IoT Real-Time Insights services have been merged!  If you create new Watson IoT Platform service in Bluemix you will immediately see the integrated views for the rules, actions, dashboards, and schemas for Real-Time Insights.  For legacy users with existing Real-Time Insights services, we'll be migrating those over the coming weeks--please hold tight.  </p></blockquote>

<p>As you all know, IoT Real-Time Insights is tightly linked to the IoT Platform service in Bluemix with the two services sharing many similar views of devices, device status, and data. After some deliberation, we've decided to simplify things in order to provide a more consistent, integrated user experience for our IoT customers, and as a result, we've decided to fold the Real-Time Insights service into the IoT Platform service.

</p><p>In the coming weeks, we will begin making some minor updates to the service in preparation for this merger. We'll make every effort to make this transition smooth and seamless, and we'll let you know within the service when something has changed. Rest assured that we will continue to support all the same great function, and we'll migrate all of your user data, including schemas, rules, and actions.

</p><p>One great benefit you will see right away is the new dashboards in the IoT Platform which we will be extending with Real-Time Insights views (now called boards and cards) – read more about them <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotplatform/2016/02/16/new-name-and-new-look/" target="_blank">here</a>.

</p><p>One final note--as part of this change we are also updating the IoT Platform pricing metrics to include the Real-Time Insights ‘data analyzed’ metric, and we're updating the pricing model to make it simpler and easier to understand--stay tuned for more details on this.

</p><p>We're looking forward to working with you and hearing from you as we continue to evolve and improve the IoT Platform service and its analytics capabilties!

</p><p>Thanks from the Watson IoT Platform team!
