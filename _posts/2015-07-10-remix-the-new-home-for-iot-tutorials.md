Are you looking for inspiration to get started on an Internet of Things project?  Or do you have inspiration you'd like to share with others?  If so, check out developerWorks Recipes.  It's a new venue that allows any IBM Bluemix user to quickly author and share their content with the rest of the community.</br>  
</br>
You might find something that gives you a head start so you don't have to develop your own project from scratch - or you might be the catalyst for someone else who is creating an app or connecting a device. Just take existing elements and mix them to meet your needs.  Yes, you can start with existing recipes and compose them with your own material to make something new.</br> 
</br>
Maybe you are looking to build an application that collects vehicle telemetry data, or perhaps you are building a home automation solution? Visit the site today and you will find a variety of recipes that make it straightforward to connect your hardware, run advanced analytics, utilize machine learning and tap into additional Bluemix services including data storage, predictive modeling and geospatial analytics.  All of this will help you better understand the data on your devices and accelerate the IoT ecosystem.   In fact, it's so straightforward that anyone can begin connecting their IoT devices to the cloud.  You don't have to be an advanced developer.  You certainly can be, but that's the great thing about developerWorks Recipes - even a novice who's just curious about IoT apps can follow along with the tutorials and tap into IoT data from their cell phones or other devices.</br>  
</br>
Why did we create developerWorks Recipes?  We know there's a lot of confusion about what IoT is and we wanted to be able to showcase some concrete examples of what people are doing with it.  We want you to be a self-starter when it comes to development for the Internet of Things.  We also have very strong relationships with an ecosystem of technology partners - so this is a great forum for them to show you how to get started with recipes for their devices.</br>
