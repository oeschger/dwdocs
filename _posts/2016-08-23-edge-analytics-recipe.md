There are literally <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/recipes/" target="_blank">hundreds</a> out on developerWorks! And we just posted a new one on getting started with edge analytics.</p>

<p>Edge analytics is an approach to data collection and analysis in which automated analytical computations are performed on data close to the source instead of waiting for the data to be sent back to a centralized location. These analytical services can run on a router, switch, gateway, or server in the operational environment. Analyzing data as it is generated decreases latency in responding to emerging conditions, and increases scalability by filtering out low value data and reducing the network burden of moving large volumes of data. By distributing data processing and analytics out to the edge of the network, you can more easily apply a rich set of analytics on site with flexibility to start small and scale up and still maintain continuous operations even if the network goes down.

<p>The new recipe shows you how to turn a Raspberry Pi into a gateway device capable of running edge analytics to process the data from devices that are connected to it.  The recipe can be found at this <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/getting-started-with-edge-analytics-in-watson-iot-platform/" target="_blank">link</a>.  Enjoy!</p>
