We are pleased to announce the new and improved <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iot/" target="_blank">IoT Foundation recipes </a>page! This makes it much easier for you to find an appropriate recipe to use to connect to the IoT Foundation. The new design offers:

<ul>
	<li>New recipes from IBM Business Partners</li>
	<li>Categorisation and color-coding of recipes for different devices, applications and Bluemix</li>
	<li>A new search facility to find the recipe you need</li>
	<li>A new reference category to provide technical information on the IoT Foundation</li>
</ul>
Please let us know if you have any feedback.
