Looking to apply machine learning algorithms to analyze IoT events?  Good news - we have released a new recipe aimed at Data Scientists. <br /><br />The latest recipe integrates JUPYTER notebook with IBM Watson IoT Platform and show cases several samples. The Samples include python scripts to query the events from historical database, apply queries to aggregate data for computing averages, and use matplotlib libraries to visualize the data graphically. The information provides great details for a Data Scientist to build and use their own custom algorithms to glean new insights. <br /><br />Do visit the recipe to get started: <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/timeseries-data-analysis-of-iot-events-by-using-jupyter-notebook/" target="_blank">Timeseries Data Analysis of IoT events by using Jupyter Notebook</a>
