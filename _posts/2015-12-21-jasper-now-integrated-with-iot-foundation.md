Today I am pleased to report that we have completed the work to support integration with our partners at Jasper. This combines IoT Foundation with the power of the Jasper IoT network service platform. With this direct integration you can view and control all of your devices deployed on Jasper’s Control Center directly through the IoT Foundation console.<br /><br />So what exactly does this enable? In addition to  all the device management already provided by IoT Foundation, from the same device console you can now:<br /><ul><li>Activate and deactivate the associated network service</li><li>View the current and historical network usage</li><li>Send the device an SMS message (for testing, diagnostics, or AT commands.)</li><li>Change the rate plan for the device in Control Center</li></ul>Plus, you can incorporate this device information into analytics and actions as you build out your application.<br /><br />Customers interested in exploring this integration can pair a Bluemix trial with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jasper.com/operators/where-to-get">Control Center trial</a>.  Trial kits are available from Jasper partner operators around the globe – and include the API credentials needed to view and control devices deployed on Control Center from within the IoT Foundation dashboard.<br /><br />At a high level the steps involved in configuring this new integration are:<br /><ul><li>Enable the Jasper extension in your IoT Foundation organisation  using your Control Center credentials and license key.</li><li>Add Control Center device ID (ICCID) to devices registered with IoT Foundation.</li><li>The device is now enabled for all the Jasper extensions from within the one IoT Foundation console.</li></ul><br />This support is the first of many extension points for IoT Foundation where we are building direct connections to our partners’ IoT solutions. <br /><br />Get started with this extension now by following the tutorial in our <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/jasper-control-center-integration/">Jasper recipe</a>. <br /><br /><hr /><br />Related Links:<br /><ul><li>developerWorks Recpie: <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/jasper-control-center-integration/">Jasper Control Center Platform Integration</a></li><li>IoT Foundation Extensions Documentation: <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/reference/extensions/index.html">https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/reference/extensions/index.html </a></li><li>Getting started with Jasper Trial kits: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jasper.com/operators/where-to-get">http://www.jasper.com/operators/where-to-get</a></li><li>Jasper Strikes Alliance to Integrate with IBM IoT Foundation (Jasper press announcement): <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jasper.com/press-news/press-releases/jasper-strikes-alliance-integrate-ibm-iot-foundation">http://www.jasper.com/press-news/press-releases/jasper-strikes-alliance-integrate-ibm-iot-foundation</a></li></ul>
