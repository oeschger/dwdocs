IBM Watson IoT issued a "Best Use of Watson IoT and Cognitive APIs Challenge" at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.semiconwest.org/live">SEMICON</a> West <a target="_blank" href="http://www.readwritehackathons.com/semicon-iiot-hackathon">Industrial IoT Hackathon</a> on July 13-14.  Hosted by <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/ReadWrite/" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=65491870325">ReadWrite</a>, the hackathon focused on IIoT use cases.  Nine projects vied for the "Best Use of Watson IoT and Cognitive APIs Challenge" prize.  All of the sponsor award winning projects leveraged Watson Cognitive APIs.   ReadWrite captured several of their project presentations on ReadWrite Live!  <br /><br />In this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ReadWrite/videos/vb.65491870325/10153910468785326/?type=2&theater">video</a>, I listened to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-dubey-ab39863">Rahul Dubey</a> talk about an industrial freezer architecture design that used Intel's new <a target="_blank" href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/gateways">IoT Gateway device</a>, edge Node-RED processing and cloud based Watson IoT data analytics using Node-RED.   Rahul based his project on an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/tracks/iot_track_overview">IBM Bluemix Garage Method IoT Track scenario</a> and was awarded the Best Use of Intel Technology.<br /><br />The ServiceIoT project created a Smart Chat Box to Monitor, Troubleshoot, and Manage your Machines.  Using the smart chatbox to communicate the data, you can ask, “what is the current noise level” for a particular machine, to which it would respond with a measurement. Going beyond simple measured readings using IBM Watson Dialogue Retrieve and Ranking service, when notified of an out-of-range reading, you can ask, “what’s the problem”, “how do I fix it”, and “who is responsible” to get a real-time solution to your problem without having to wait for a technician.<br /><br />The <strong>"Best Use of Watson IoT and Cognitive APIs Challenge"</strong> prize was awarded to the Team LEO Smart Irrigation team lead by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Sreejumon/status/753827896226041856">Sreejumon Purayil</a>.  His project used a variety of water, soil moisture, temperature, humidity sensors connected to an Intel Edison board that sent data using Node-RED to the Watson IoT platform to control a pump motor connected back down on the Edison board.   Check out all of the impressive projects submitted on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackster.io/hackathons/iiot_hackathon/iiot-hackathon/info">Hackster.io</a> page.<br /><br />The SEMICON Grand Prize Winner was awarded to EcoByte for their Pollution Awareness Platform.  Team Ecobyte’s pollution awareness platform provides interactive environmental information to enable residents’ enhanced well-being. Ecobyte’s product leverages air pollution data from pollution sensors placed on lamp posts throughout the city. Their solution provides holistic pollution information to the city and residents through a hosted Bluemix-cloud platform that posted pollution sensor data to a twitter feed. They present 4 minutes into this <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/tv/presentations-winners-industrial-iot-hackathon/">video</a>.<br /><br /><img src="http://semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/scw16-hackathon_365x267.jpg" alt="SemiCon IIoT Hackathon" class="aligncenter" height="267" width="365" /><br />ReadWrite Live! also captured me <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/tv/john-walicki-demos-watson-iot-platform-industrial-iot-hackathon/">talking about Watson IoT capabilities</a>.
