    <p style="margin: 5px;margin-top: 50px;">IBM <a href="http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/" target="_blank">Watson IoT</a> sponsored the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/att-public-sector-hackathon-washington-dc-tickets-27011803030" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Government Solutions hackathon</a> on September 16 – 17<sup>th</sup> in Washington DC. Developers from government agencies, universities, industry and the DC community arrived at Howard University on Friday evening and hacked on projects until 9pm Saturday. AT&amp;T and additional sponsors from <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/cloud-analytics/ibm" target="_blank">Intel</a>, Cisco and the EPA provided the developers with incentives to create cool projects in categories of Smart City, Sustainability and Public Safety that supported the hackathon's theme to develop new innovative applications driving Government efficiency and effectiveness leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT). IBM awarded teams which demonstrated the Best use of the Watson platform.</p>

<p style="margin: 5px;margin-top: 50px;">The Super Hydrant project team of Stacie Whisonant, Seth Jerry, Beverlee Turner and Angelo Brown created an <a href="http://bluemix.net" target="_blank">IBM Bluemix</a> application that follows the Twitter hashtag #badhydrant and analyzes the pictures posted in the tweets. They trained the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html" target="_blank">Watson Visual Recognition service</a> to identify leaking or broken fire hydrants. The information is available to city officials on a dashboard. The city could dispatch a crew to repair the hydrant before a possible neighborhood fire becomes a catastrophic lose. They were also awarded the Best Smart City prize for their innovation. The powerful Watson Cognitive APIs that provide visual image recognition made this automated application possible.</p>

<p style="margin: 5px;margin-top: 50px;">The 2nd place winner of the Best Use of Watson award was given to JW Grenadier for her Jam Justice idea. The educational site was hosted on Bluemix and provides information about local, city, state, and federal laws and the fines and prison penalties of committing a crime. The legal code is often confusing and hidden from average citizens that might not be aware of the serious ramifications of committing a crime. Jam Justice could use the Watson Cognitive Alchemy APIs to summarize the legal code. The potential to disrupt the Legal system is long overdue.</p>

<p style="margin: 5px;margin-top: 50px;">Numerous other projects leveraged IBM Bluemix services, Watson Cognitive APIs, <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank">Node-RED</a> and Watson IoT. The Best Overall and Best Sustainability award was given to the Qmunicator team for their city reporting mobile application, website and dispatch mapping service. Exciting 21st century digital upgrade to the 411 / 311 services that many cities run today.</p>
