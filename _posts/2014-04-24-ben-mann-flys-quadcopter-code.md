Earlier this week IBM sponsored an M2M Hackathon in London. The event was a huge success seeing many developers attend the event, who all engaged with our IBM open source software, the gadgets we brought along and the IBM staff as well.

The picture above shows Allen, an IBM’er, teaching a developer how to use Node-Red.

IBM’s brief revolved around a ‘Roboapocolypse’ in London, where hackers had to fight for survival in a Demo which we normally use to demonstrate our IBM MessageSight appliance. The hackers could use Node-Red to wire the Internet of Things then combat the Roboapocolypse! 

You can check out Node-Red for yourself here: <a href="http://nodered.org/" title="http://nodered.org/">http://nodered.org/</a> 
Node-Red is a visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things, the hackers really enjoyed using it and we’re very happy to see it being used in some awesome M2M technology!
