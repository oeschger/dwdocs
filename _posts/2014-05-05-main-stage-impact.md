On day 3 of the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/videos/">IBM Impact 2014 Global Conference</a> the IoT Cloud got it's first public showing on the main stage.

In front of 9000+ people and many more watching live online Michael Curry, the VP for WebSphere Foundation Product Management, presented a live entertaining demo.
