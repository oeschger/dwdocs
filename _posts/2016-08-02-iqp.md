In some cases it can even double sales success rate by providing tangible results faster than the competition.<br /><br />These are my top 3 take-a-ways from the recent blog <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/bluemix/2016/08/01/enhance-ibm-iot-sales-pitches-with-iqp/" target="_blank">Enhance your IBM IoT sales pitches with IQP</a> written by their founder and CEO <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/bluemix/author/guy-kaplinsky/" target="_blank">Guy Kaplinsky</a>.<br /><ol><li>Show, don't tell - Create an impact by taking tangible applications to your clients that demonstrate what you can do with IoT.</li><li>IQP is robust enough for commercial use. Every prototype can be extended and enhanced from the initial demo, to the proof of concept and eventually to production.</li><li>It is available for free as part of your Bluemix access. </li></ol><a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/bluemix/2016/05/11/code-free-applications-for-bluemix-and-watson-iot-platform/" target="_blank">Learn more</a> about IQP, the code-free applications for Bluemix and Watson IoT Platform.<br /><a href="mailto:info@iqpiot.com" target="_blank">Contact IQP</a><span> for a full demo and learn how to get started with the IQP-IBM sales training program.</span><br /><br /><p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5o8iiZCLbM[/embed]</p>
