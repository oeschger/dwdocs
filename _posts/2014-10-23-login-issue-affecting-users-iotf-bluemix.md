We have identified an issue affecting users of the IOTF from Bluemix when their IBM ID contains one or more uppercase characters.  A fix will be applied to the system today and an update posted once complete.<br /><br />This problem will manifest itself if, once clicking the "Launch" button in the Bluemix service dashboard, you are not able to see your IOTF organization or you are immediately redirected to our "signup" page.  Once the update is applied no action is required your part, the next time you click "Launch" you will be able to work with your IOTF organization.
