<a href="http://ibm.biz/IoTCoursera"></a>IBM has teamed up with Coursera to deliver an entry level course on developing solutions for the Internet of Things. This course is designed to put the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) in your hands. In this course you can learn how to create connected solutions and leverage IoT technology and data in ways previously only available to large R&amp;D departments. <br /><br />This course includes an exciting hands-on experience with a <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-80899" target="_blank">Raspberry-Pi</a>, a <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-78155/l/raspberry-pi-sense-hat" target="_blank">SenseHat</a>, <a href="http://nodered.org/" target="_blank">Node-RED</a> and the<a href="http://discover-iot.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/?cm_mc_uid=75870880301514568578379&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1461700024#/try/" target="_blank"> IBM Watson IoT Platform</a>. In the process, you will learn the architecture of an IoT solution, along with the design principles and concepts behind it. You will need your own hardware for the hands-on component of the course: a Raspberry-Pi, and optionally, a SenseHAT. A virtual SenseHAT is provided if you don't wish to purchase a physical unit. <br /><br />To access the course for free simply register and select the "audit only" option. A payment is only required if you would like to be graded and receive a certificate from Coursera. <br /><br /> Learn more<br /><a href="http://ibm.biz/IoTCoursera" target="_blank">http://ibm.biz/IoTCoursera</a><br /><br /><a href="http://ibm.biz/IoTCoursera"><img src="http://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotplatform/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2016/04/WatsonIoT_CourseraST1-1024x535.jpg" alt="WatsonIoT_CourseraST1" width="640" height="334" class="aligncenter wp-image-2980 size-large" /></a>
