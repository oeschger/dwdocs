I'm pleased to announce that the IoT Platform is now available as a Dedicated offering.  <br /><h3>What is Dedicated?</h3>To date Internet of Things Foundation has been available as a <strong>Public cloud</strong> service.   This is great as it's quick to get started, offers simple sign up, and pay as you go pricing.  What happens if you need tighter control over the hardware, or have data sovereignty requirements that mean you need to define exactly which where your data lives?  <br />That's where <strong>Dedicated</strong> comes in.  With our Dedicated offering, you can have Internet of Things Foundation deployed in any of the 40+ SoftLayer datacenters around the world.   <a href="http://www.softlayer.com/data-centers">http://www.softlayer.com/data-centers</a><br /><br />With Dedicated: <br /><ul><li>You get exclusive, identifiable hardware in a specific SoftLayer datacenter</li><li>Guarantees that your data is isolated, using physically isolated hardware</li><li>Feels like home - using VPN or Direct Link technology to feel like another node on your network</li><li>Allows you to show compliance with Data Sovereignty requirements</li><li>May be needed for PCI data</li><li>More control over planned outages</li></ul>Which all results in peace of mind when you need tight control over your data.  <br /><h3>What else do I need to know?</h3><h4>Pricing and deployment</h4>Dedicated is priced differently from Public Cloud.  You pay in larger increments of capability, rather than pay-as-you-go.  <br />Our base instance supports 100,000 devices, and you can add additional instances to support larger deployments.  <br /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/2/877/ENUSZP16-0102/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en">Announcement letter for Dedicated</a></p>
