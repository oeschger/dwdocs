We will shortly be undertaking work to enhance our back-end database infrastructure as we prepare to make the IoT Foundation available as a production platform.  As part of this preparation we will unfortunately have to make a breaking change to the platform and therefore following the deployment of the next beta driver we will reset the state of the configuration information and we will be changing the Organisation ID to be a 6 character string (instead of the existing 5 characters).  This will result in all of the data in existing organisations being deleted including member lists, the device registry & API keys.

We do appreciate this will cause some disruption for our users as you will need to re-register your devices and applications under new organisations to restore connectivity to the IoT Foundation.   However we need to make these changes to ensure that as we move toward our production deployment we can provide the back-end reliability and scalability you will need for your IoT applications.

Further details on the timing of this update will be posted on this blog.
