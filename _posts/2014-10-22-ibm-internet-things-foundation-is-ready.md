<p>I am delighted to be able to report that our production service is now live. When combined with the IBM Bluemix platform, <a href="https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com">IBM Internet of Things Foundation</a> provides simple, but powerful, and scalable application access to devices and their data. You can rapidly build analytics applications, visualization dashboards, mobile apps, and applications that can feed your back-end enterprise with IoT. This significant milestone marks the end of the Beta that has been running since July. For all of you that participated in that Beta we thank you for your participation, the questions and the feedback that has shaped what we have today.</p>

<p>For those of your reading this who are new to this service IoT Foundation enables you to:</p><ul><li><strong>Connect:</strong> Securely connect things to your applications</li><li><strong>Collect:</strong> Collect and manage a time-series view of data from things</li><li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Visually assemble flows to process your data with <a href="http://nodered.org/">Node-Red</a> and Bluemix</li><li><strong>Manage:</strong> Manage connections and subscriptions with a highly scalable service</li></ul><p><br />We have already been working in partnership with a number of device manufacturers including <span> </span><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/45102.wss">ARM, B&amp;B Electronics, Elecsys, Intel, Multi-Tech Systems, Inc. and Texas Instruments</a><span> </span>.</p><p>Read on to learn more about the core capabilities of this service, how it will be charged for and start connecting your own devices. If Bluemix is where you naturally build your applications you should read the tailored version of this article <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/bluemix/2014/10/22/calling-things-ibm-internet-things-foundation-ready/">posted to the Bluemix blog</a>.</p>

<h2>The core capabilities of IoT Foundation</h2>
<p><strong>Register and Connect to a wide variety of devices</strong>. In minutes you can have something running with our<span> </span><a href="https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/">Quickstart</a> which visualizes live data from your device. Next, you can register your device with the IoT Foundation to protect its data, ensuring that it is only visible to the applications you compose with it. You can also see which devices are connected and the last messages they sent. Development boards and devices from a number of our partners are connected to the service using<span> </span><a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iot/">recipes</a>. Extend these recipes to get the data you need for your next Internet of Things application.</p><p><strong>Collect data from your devices.  </strong>IoT data visualization lets you see what is happening on your devices in near-real time. The service stores your device events in a time-series database historian.  You can build dashboards and gain access to historical data through<span> </span><a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iot/recipes/api-documentation/">HTTP based APIs</a> and then  get that data currently trapped on instrumented devices back to your business.</p><p><strong>Assemble IoT events</strong><span> with your applications and other services running in Bluemix. The<span> </span></span><a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/IoT/index.html#iot500">IoT Starter Application</a><span> uses the simple drag-and-drop interface of Node-RED to let you easily assemble applications built from the IoT Foundation and other Bluemix services.  You can use these capabilities to optimize decision making based on the real data streaming off your sensors.</span></p>

<h2>Charging model</h2>
<p>The service measures and charges for the following usage:</p><ol><li><span>The number of devices connected</span></li><li><span>The amount of data the devices exchange with the system and applications</span></li><li><span>The amount of data stored in the historian</span></li></ol><p><span>It is available through Bluemix, as a pay as you go option through the IBM Marketplace and via your IBM sales representative. We include free plans in Bluemix along with a Trial from the marketplace. These options include limits that allow you to get started and begin building your IoT applications and proof of concepts with no cost for the service. </span></p><p><span> </span></p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>So now to how to get started with this service… Head over to the web based simulator documented <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iot/recipes/simulator/">here</a>. This will act as your device for the few next steps. Following the instructions leads you to the visualization hosted in our Quickstart service which shows live data flowing from your device. Not convinced that these things are sending data via our service? Then run the two on separate machines or mobile devices and all you need to do is enter the device identifier from one to the other.</p><p>Moving beyond the simulator we have <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iot/">recipes</a> that show you how to register and connect a number of devices to the service. If you have another device not on this list the recipes also tell you what you need to know to write your own. Other recipes show you how to consume device data through Node-RED or integrate with other services in Bluemix.</p><p>Extend the value of your things by accessing the data that has previously been locked away. Deliver transformational change to your business models and disruption to your market. Optimize your processes and business by understanding the real use and behaviour of your things. Finally take control and affect the behaviour of your things.<br /><br />We’re excited to see what you’ll build and, as always reach out to us in either the <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/answers/?community=bluemix">Bluemix Developer forums </a> or our <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/answers/?community=iot">IoT forums</a> if you have questions.</p><p>IBM Internet of Things Foundation is ready… we look forward to welcoming your devices!</p>
