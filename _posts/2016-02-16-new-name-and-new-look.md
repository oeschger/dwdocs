<h2>New Dashboard</h2>I'm pleased to announce the that the IBM Watson IoT Platform has a great new look! <br />When you login to the dashboard, you'll see that we have a completely new look and feel.  Menu items you access frequently are now available from a menu bar along the left hand side.  <br /><br /><a href="http://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotfoundation/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2016/02/dashboard1.jpg"><img src="http://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotfoundation/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2016/02/dashboard1-1024x693.jpg" alt="dashboard" class=" wp-image-2692 size-large alignnone" height="433" width="640" /></a><br /><br />The overview pane is completely redesigned around a set of what we are calling 'cards'.  Each card displays a set of useful data.  You can move and resize the cards to suit how you want to look at the data.  <br /><p><a href="http://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotfoundation/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2016/02/cards.jpg"><img src="http://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotfoundation/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2016/02/cards-1024x822.jpg" alt="cards" class="alignnone wp-image-2696 size-large" height="514" width="640" /><br /></a></p><p>You'll also find the UI now automatically adjusts itself to view nicely on your mobile device for when you're out and about. <br /><br />Login and take a look!</p>
