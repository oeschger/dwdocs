I hope you'll have all seen our recent announcements including our new IBM Watson IoT division and our new global <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/48443.wss">IoT headquarters in Munich</a>.  <br /><br />As part of that the Internet of Things Foundation is evolving to become the <strong>IBM Watson IoT Platform</strong>. <br /><p><br />The platform will offer all of the features that you're familiar with and will be expanding with new capabilities across Connect, Information Management, Analytics and Risk Management.  <br /><br />We'll be updating the product, documentation and recipes over the coming weeks, so look out for the changes!</p>
