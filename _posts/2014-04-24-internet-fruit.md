At the M2M Hackathon this week we believe we’ve created a first. We can’t prove it or anything. But we’re pretty confident this hasn’t been achieved before. We’ve managed to combine the two most awesomely delicious things in existence: The Internet of Things and Fruit. To get a little more specific – in case for some reason it’s not 100% crystal clear yet – we’re talking about controlling the Internet of Things with fruit.

Why would I ever need to do this, you might ask… and with good reason. As organizations throughout the planet grapple with sensing and controlling the world around through an Internet of connected sensors and devices, the role of the humble banana or the citrusy zest of an orange may not be the top of everyone’s list of enabling technologies. But as we will now demonstrate, be careful not to overlook the power of nature’s bounty, in controlling the connected world.

<b>Step 1</b> is to get your hands on the awesome “Makey Makey.” It’s a cheeky little Arduino based board specialised to convert electrical signals into keyboard commands. Setting this up is a joy. Simply un-box it. Whack the small end of the USB cable into Makey Makey and the big end into your laptop. With Windows the device should be automagically recognised.

<b>Step 2</b> is to ground yourself. Attach a croc clip to the ground “bit” of the Makey Makey and attach the other part to yourself. The best way to do this is either to keep hold of the other end, or if you wear a ring attach the clip to that. I’d not recommend other… ahem… personal interface points.
Now that you’re grounded, attach a croc clips for the other cables to each of the arrows “bits” on the Makey Makey.
Step 3 is to find a program that can control devices in the Internet of Things using keyboard commands. Where on earth can I find such an epic program, you might ask… Look not further than Bryan Boyds spectacular Internet of Things hack demo here:

You’ll notice the demo shows 20 pesky robots terrorizing the South Kensington area of London. The red dot is you. Time to run away from those robots using the power of fruit.

<b>Step 4.</b> In a separate windows, open up this clever little console. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard of your laptop and notice you can navigate your red dot through the streets of London to escape the Robot Uprising.

Ok… now that might be the most awesome thing you’ve seen all week… the way your Web browser publishes MQTT messages up into an Internet of Things cloud and the way the Robots react to your presence by changing their status colour. And it’s pretty rooting tooting diggity awesome.
But we need more fruit!

<strong>Step 5.</strong> Acquire some fruit. We haven’t done extensive testing in this regard. But bananas and oranges work just fine. Ideally you want fruit that is durable and firm. And easy to get a good grip on with croc clips. Simply attach or insert the croc clips into the fruit (full insertion seems to give the best responsiveness), organise the fruit so that the each piece corresponds to up, down, left and right and your fruit powered, Internet of Things cloud connected, Robot uprising escaping solution is complete.

Simply pilot your red dot by touching or holding the fruit, and behold the power of the Internet of Things.
