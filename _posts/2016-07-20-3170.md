<p>A strong and diverse ecosystem is critical <span>to help business across numerous industries to leverage the power of Cognitive IoT.  </span>In a recent <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotplatform/2016/07/13/watson-iot-and-att/">blog post</a> Bret Greenstein announced an exciting new partnership between IBM and AT&amp;T t<span>o bring the next wave of powerful new technologies and services to IoT developers,  entrepreneurs and enterprises alike. </span><br /><br />As part of that ongoing collaboration, I'm pleased to report that IBM's Watson IoT Platform now includes a built in integration with AT&amp;T's Control Center.  With this new integration, devices in the IoT Platform can be linked to AT&amp;T Control Center to allow quick access to billing and usage information, SIM card state, and other information.<br /><br />From Watson IoT Platform, you can configure the integration very quickly, by just providing information about your AT&amp;T Control Center account. Then you can add the ICCID (SIM identifier) from AT&amp;T to the device's details, after which you can view and control AT&amp;T Control Center devices directly from the Watson IoT Platform dashboard.<br /><br />AT&amp;T Control Center is powered by Jasper so you can g<span>et started with now by following the tutorial in our </span><a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/jasper-control-center-integration/">Jasper recipe</a><span>.  Just remember to pick the AT&amp;T option on the settings page.</span><br /><br /><span>This integration is part of our ongoing efforts to simplify and provide more value in IoT deployments through linkages with our Watson IoT partners.</span></p><p><strong>Further Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/50168.wss" target="_blank">IBM Watson IoT &amp; AT&amp;T partnership Press Release</a></li><li><span></span><a href="http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/ecosystem/devices/raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a></li><li><span></span><a href="http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/learn/library/build-skills/" target="_blank">IoT developers by Coursera</a></li><li><a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/recipes/" target="_blank">DeveloperWorks Recipes Page</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/learn/library/build-skills/" target="_blank">Developer Resources for IBM Watson IoT</a></li></ul><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/IBMIoT" target="_blank">@IBMIoT</a> on Twitter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
