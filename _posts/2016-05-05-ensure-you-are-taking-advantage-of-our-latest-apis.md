In August last year we released version 2 of the Watson IoT Platform APIs, including all the features from the version 1 API and introducing new features and new ways to interact with existing features of the platform, including: <br /><ul><li>Device Management, including firmware download, update and reboot</li><li>Bulk operations - to register multiple devices at once</li><li>Get and update device location</li><li>Diagnostics: Access logs and error codes</li><li>Status of the service</li><li>Access extension services </li></ul><a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/swagger/v0002.html">Swagger version 2 API documentation</a><br /><br />If you aren't taking advantage of the version 2 APIs, we recommend making the change now and starting to take advantage of these great new features.  <br />If you're using our Watson IoT client libraries, then you'll find you're already using our version 2 APIs (providing you have updated your libraries since November 2015).  <br /><h3>Watson IoT client libraries</h3><ul><ul><li><a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/python.html">python</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/nodejs.html">nodejs</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/java.html">java</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/c_sharp.html">C#</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/embedded_c.html">Embedded C</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/mbedcpp.html">mBed C++</a></li></ul></ul><h3>Withdrawal of the version 1 APIs</h3>We know that many users have already moved, but be aware that we plan to discontinue support of the version 1 APIs meaning they will no longer be available from <strong>1st June 2016</strong>.<br /><h3>How to migrate if you are using version 1 APIs</h3>If you're using our Watson IoT client libraries, then just download the latest version for your language and environment from the links above.<br />If you are calling the RESTful apis directly from another client, then you'll need to check whether the URLs have changed for the functionality that you're using. <br /><br />See <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotplatform/2016/04/28/updating-to-version-2-of-the-platform-api/">this blog post</a> for details of changes between the version 1 and version 2 APIs and the kinds of changes you'll need to make in your application.  <br /><br />For reference:<br /><ul><li>Old <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/swagger/v0001.html">swagger Version 1  documentation</a></li><li>New <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/swagger/v0002.html">Swagger version 2 API documentation</a> </li></ul>If you are still using the version 1 API and have any questions about migrating your applications to the current version of the API please <a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/answers/smartspace/internet-of-things/">get in touch</a>.
