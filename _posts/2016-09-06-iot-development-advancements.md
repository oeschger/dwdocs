We have collaborated with universities and delivered many seminars, but our broadest reach comes from our <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-iot" target="_blank">free course</a> on Coursera which has already trained thousands of students and continues to be the first and only of its kind.</p><p>We will never cease to innovate, inspire and strengthen our partnerships with other IoT providers and our developers.  I hope that you will find this newsletter useful along your IoT Journey. And <a href="http://ibm.co/tell-me-a-story" target="_blank">we want to hear from you</a> – share your thoughts, tell us about your innovative projects, and if we can, we will feature your responses in the next issue. </p><p>Cheers,</p>Bret Greenstein, Vice President, Watson Internet of Things Platform, IBM Watson IoT<br /><br /><br /><!--more--><h2>Watson IoT Platform Newsletter <a href="http://ibm.co/watson-iot-newsletter"><img src="http://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotplatform/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2016/09/Newsletter.jpg" alt="Newsletter" width="255" height="173" class="  wp-image-3396 alignright" /></a></h2><ul><li><a href="http://ibm.co/watson-iot-newsletter" target="_blank">Register for the Watson IoT Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="http://ibm.co/2bTqRrz" target="_blank">Watson IoT Newsletter - September 2016 Issue</a></li><li><a href="http://ibm.co/tell-me-a-story" target="_blank">Spread your IoT ideas and share your projects</a></li></ul><br /><br /><br />
