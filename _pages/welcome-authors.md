<p><i>Welcome!</i> </p>
<p>Now that we've got you in the system, here are the next steps:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/profiles/html/editMyProfileView.do">Update your profile photo</a> in your developerWorks profile.  Currently, only the photo is pulled into the author profile in WordPress.</li>
<li><a href="https://nextstage.torolab.ibm.com/iotplatform/wp-admin/profile.php">Update social accounts and bio info</a> in WordPress.  The fields for Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn appear about half way down the page.  The Biographical Info field appears near the bottom of the page.  Scroll to the bottom and click <strong>Update Profile</strong> when you are done.</li> 
</ol>
